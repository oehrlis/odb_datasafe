# Release Notes v0.17.3

## Highlights

This patch release focuses on operational reliability and output readability in
Data Safe target management workflows.

- fixed invalid OCI create wait-state usage in `ds_target_register.sh`
- fixed registration error-exit handling to return proper exit code `2`
- fixed issue-details table alignment for long issue labels in
  `ds_target_list.sh`

## Fixed

### `ds_target_register.sh` create wait and error handling

- Updated Data Safe target creation wait states to valid OCI operation states:
  `SUCCEEDED` and `FAILED`.
- Removed invalid `ACTIVE` wait state usage that caused immediate CLI
  validation failures.
- Corrected fatal error invocation so failed registrations return cleanly with
  exit code `2` (without secondary shell `numeric argument required` noise).

### `ds_target_list.sh` issue-details alignment

- Improved `--mode health|problems --issue-view details` table output for long
  issue labels by using a wider fixed `Issue` column.
- Added truncation with ellipsis for overflow issue labels so `Severity` and
  subsequent columns remain aligned.

## Testing

- `bats tests/script_ds_target_list.bats` (pass)
- `bats tests/script_ds_target_register.bats` (pass)

## Documentation

- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` for release `0.17.3`.
