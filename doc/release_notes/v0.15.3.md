# OraDBA Data Safe Extension v0.15.3

Release date: 2026-02-19

## Highlights

- Credential updates now run non-interactively by default in apply mode.
- Added explicit force-mode opt-out for interactive confirmation workflows.
- Improved lifecycle safety for credential updates by restricting updates to
  `ACTIVE` and `NEEDS_ATTENTION` targets and skipping non-updatable states.

## What Changed

### Changed

- `bin/ds_target_update_credentials.sh`
  - Apply mode now enables force behavior by default to avoid OCI confirmation
    prompt failures in automation and bulk runs.
  - Added `--no-force` to opt out when interactive OCI confirmation is desired.

### Fixed

- `bin/ds_target_update_credentials.sh`
  - Credential updates now only execute for targets in `ACTIVE` or
    `NEEDS_ATTENTION` lifecycle state.
  - Targets in non-updatable states (for example `UPDATING`) are skipped with
    a warning instead of producing hard update errors.
  - Added a current-state re-check immediately before each update to reduce
    transient failures when target state changes during long runs.

## Affected Files

- `bin/ds_target_update_credentials.sh`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
