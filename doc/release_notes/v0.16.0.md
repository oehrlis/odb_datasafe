# Release Notes v0.16.0

## Highlights

This release introduces a comprehensive target landscape overview and a new
health/troubleshooting mode in `ds_target_list.sh`, plus credential-update
behavior fixes for better scope consistency and root-user handling.

## Added

### Target Landscape Overview

- Added `--overview` mode in `bin/ds_target_list.sh` to build a grouped local
  landscape report from selected targets.
- Grouping uses the default naming pattern
  `<cluster>_<oracle_sid>_<cdb/pdb>` and reports:
  - `cdbroot_count`
  - `pdb_count`
  - `total_count`
  - member lists
- Added overview options:
  - `--overview-no-status`
  - `--overview-no-members`
  - `--overview-truncate-members`
  - `--overview-no-truncate-members`
- Added overview footer grand totals for clusters, Oracle SIDs, CDB roots,
  PDBs, and total targets.
- Added configurable parser settings:
  - `DS_TARGET_NAME_REGEX`
  - `DS_TARGET_NAME_SEPARATOR`
  - `DS_TARGET_NAME_SID_REGEX`
  - `DS_TARGET_NAME_CDBROOT_REGEX`
  - `DS_TARGET_NAME_ROOT_LABEL`

### Health & Troubleshooting (v1/v2)

- Added `--health-overview` and `--health-details` to
  `bin/ds_target_list.sh` for scope-based troubleshooting.
- Added `--health-actions` / `--health-no-actions` to control suggested
  remediation output.
- Added naming-standard anomaly detection (`TARGET_NAMING_NONSTANDARD`).
- Added v1 health checks for:
  - missing/duplicate roots
  - root without PDB
  - inactive targets
  - unexpected lifecycle states
- Added v2 `NEEDS_ATTENTION` classification with action-specific categories:
  - account locked
  - credential issue
  - connectivity/timeout
  - fetch connection details
  - other
- Health overview output now sorts by severity, then count, then SID count.
- Improved health table formatting to keep severity/count/SID columns aligned.

## Fixed

### Credential Updates

- `bin/ds_target_update_credentials.sh` no longer defaults selection to
  `ACTIVE` only; it now uses the selected scope consistently (aligned with
  `ds_target_list.sh`).
- Root targets are auto-detected by name suffix (`..._CDBROOT`/
  `..._CDB$ROOT`) and `COMMON_USER_PREFIX` is applied automatically for those
  targets.

## Documentation

- Updated `README.md`, `doc/index.md`, and `doc/quickref.md` with new overview
  and credential-update behavior.
- Added `doc/troubleshooting.md` with health overview usage, issue meaning, and
  remediation guidance.
