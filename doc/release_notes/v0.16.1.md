# Release Notes v0.16.1

## Highlights

This release improves `ds_target_list.sh` usability by introducing grouped
output mode selection and by reorganizing help output so mode-specific options
are easier to discover and understand.

## Added

### Grouped Output Selection

- Added `--output-group` (`default|overview|troubleshooting`) to
  `bin/ds_target_list.sh`.
- `default` keeps standard list/count behavior.
- `overview` selects grouped landscape output (same behavior as `--overview`).
- `troubleshooting` selects problem/health workflows and defaults to
  `--health-overview` when no explicit troubleshooting mode is provided.

## Documentation

- Reorganized `bin/ds_target_list.sh --help` output into clearer sections:
  - primary mode selection
  - group selector
  - overview-only options
  - troubleshooting options
  - format/fields options
- Reduced usage examples in script help to the most important workflows.
- Added explicit quick reference pointer from script help.
- Updated `doc/index.md` and `doc/quickref.md` with `--output-group` examples.

## Notes

- No functional behavior changes were introduced outside of the new grouped
  output mode selector and help/documentation structure updates.
