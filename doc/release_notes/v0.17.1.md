# Release Notes v0.17.1

## Highlights

This patch release focuses on report readability and compatibility convenience:

- aligned `Delta vs previous run` output in `ds_target_list.sh` for consistent
  label/value formatting
- added short mode aliases in `ds_target_list.sh` for faster operator usage:
  `-C`, `-H`, `-P`, and `-R`

## Changed

### `ds_target_list.sh` report readability

- Improved alignment of the `Delta vs previous run` section using fixed-width
  labels so `:` separators line up across all rows.
- Keeps behavior unchanged while making before/after delta lines easier to scan
  in terminal output.

### `ds_target_list.sh` mode alias compatibility

- Added backward-compatible short aliases:
  - `-C` for `--mode count`
  - `-H` for `--mode health`
  - `-P` for `--mode problems`
  - `-R` for `--mode report`
- Existing long options and `--mode` behavior remain unchanged.

## Documentation

- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` for release `0.17.1`.
- Updated `doc/index.md` to point to this release note.
