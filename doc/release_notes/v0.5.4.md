# Release Notes - odb_datasafe v0.5.4

**Release Date:** 2026-01-22  
**Type:** Minor Release - Standardization, connector enhancements, and test cleanup

## Overview

This release finalizes the standardization work across the Data Safe scripts, adds
connector compartment flexibility, and aligns the test and lint suites with the
current codebase. All linters now pass, and the test suite expectations have been
updated to match the new version.

## Highlights

- **Connector enhancements**
  - Added `DS_CONNECTOR_COMP` support with new `get_connector_compartment_ocid()` helper
  - `ds_target_update_connector.sh` set/migrate/distribute modes now share consistent
    compartment handling and clearer progress output
  - Help now shows when required parameters are missing
- **Standardization & docs**
  - Template and helper docs refreshed to the latest bootstrap/order patterns
  - Resolved duplicate headings and markdown lint issues in docs
- **Testing & linting**
  - Shell and markdown lint now clean (`make lint` / `make lint-md`)
  - Version expectations in BATS tests aligned to `.extension`
  - Tests hardened for missing `.env` and non-OCI environments where applicable

## Breaking Changes

- None.

## Upgrade Notes

- Update your `.extension`/`VERSION` to v0.5.4 (already applied in this release).
- If you rely on connector compartment defaults, use `DS_CONNECTOR_COMP` in
  `datasafe.conf` to control the compartment used by connector operations.

## Verification

- `make lint` (shell + markdown): **pass**
- Core BATS suites: updated to expect v0.5.4 and pass in non-OCI environments; OCI
  dependent tests remain guarded.
