# OraDBA Data Safe Extension v0.12.1

**Release Date:** 2026-02-17

## Overview

Version 0.12.1 is a focused maintenance release for
`bin/ds_connector_update.sh` that resolves batch validation and OCI bundle
password policy issues.

## Highlights

- Fixed `--check-all` execution path so it no longer requires
  single-connector variables.
- Fixed connector bundle password handling to satisfy current OCI complexity
  requirements.

## Details

### Fixed

- `--check-all` validation flow
  - `ds_connector_update.sh --check-all` now uses dedicated batch validation.
  - The command no longer fails with
    `Missing required variables: CONNECTOR_NAME`.
- Bundle password policy compliance
  - Generated bundle passwords now meet OCI rules:
    - 12-30 characters
    - at least one uppercase character
    - at least one lowercase character
    - at least one digit
    - at least one special character
  - Existing stored passwords are validated before reuse.
  - Non-compliant stored passwords are replaced automatically.

## Testing

```bash
# Targeted regression tests
bats tests/script_ds_connector_update.bats

# Script lint check
shellcheck bin/ds_connector_update.sh
```

## Breaking Changes

None.
