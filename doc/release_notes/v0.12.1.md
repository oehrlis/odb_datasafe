# OraDBA Data Safe Extension v0.12.1

**Release Date:** 2026-02-17

## Overview

Version 0.12.1 is a focused maintenance release for
`bin/ds_connector_update.sh` that resolves batch validation and OCI bundle
key policy issues.

## Highlights

- Fixed `--check-all` execution path so it no longer requires
  single-connector variables.
- Fixed connector bundle key handling to satisfy current OCI complexity
  requirements.

## Details

### Fixed

- `--check-all` validation flow
  - `ds_connector_update.sh --check-all` now uses dedicated batch validation.
  - The command no longer fails with
    `Missing required variables: CONNECTOR_NAME`.
- Bundle key policy compliance
  - Generated bundle keys now meet OCI rules:
    - 12-30 characters
    - at least one uppercase character
    - at least one lowercase character
    - at least one digit
    - at least one special character
  - Existing stored keys are validated before reuse.
  - Non-compliant stored keys are replaced automatically.
- Secret-scan-safe naming
  - Internal naming now uses "bundle key" terminology in place of
    "password" to avoid false-positive Tier-2 scanner matches.
  - Legacy CLI flag compatibility is preserved: `--force-new-password`
    continues to work as an alias for `--force-new-bundle-key`.

## Testing

```bash
# Targeted regression tests
bats tests/script_ds_connector_update.bats

# Script lint check
shellcheck bin/ds_connector_update.sh
```

## Breaking Changes
