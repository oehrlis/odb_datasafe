# OraDBA Data Safe Extension v0.13.2

Release date: 2026-02-18

## Highlights

- `ds_version.sh` now reports effective runtime configuration files and active OCI CLI config/profile.

## What Changed

### Runtime Configuration Visibility in `ds_version.sh`

Enhanced `bin/ds_version.sh` output with a dedicated runtime section to simplify operational troubleshooting.

The script now shows:

- Config files currently in use (for example `.env`, `datasafe.conf`, and script-specific config if present)
- OCI config file path in use (`OCI_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` or default `~/.oci/config`)
- OCI config file presence check
- OCI profile in use (`OCI_CLI_PROFILE`, default `DEFAULT`)
- OCI profile presence check in the selected OCI config file

This makes it easier to validate environment and profile selection before running Data Safe operations.
